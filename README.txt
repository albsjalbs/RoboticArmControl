This Python program takes Cvzone's hand detector and serial module to send and receive data from the Arduino and uses the hand detector for input.
It will send serial data that looks something like this: $00000. If your fingers were extended, the serial input would look like $11111.
Please refer to Murtaza's video which will greatly benefit your progress in computer vision. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KV5489rL3c&t=817s .
This Python code is for those with errors importing or implementing cv zone into their project. This Python code is the same thing as importing the module but instead using source code:)
I apologize if this didn't make any sense, I am only thirteen and I am exploring the route of computer vision.
All thanks to Cvzone and Murtaza for providing code for this project that can make it easier for all of us.
